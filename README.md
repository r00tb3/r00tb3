🚀 Amit Vitekar — AI Security Engineer & Hardware/Telecom Hacker

Hi 👋 I'm Amit, an Offensive AI Security Engineer and Embedded/Wireless/Telecom Security Researcher who loves breaking systems across both the LLM world and the real hardware world.

I specialize in:

🔥 LLM Red Teaming & Agent Security

🧠 Adversarial Machine Learning

🛰️ Telecom/5G Security & RAN/Core fuzzing

🛠️ Hardware, Firmware & Embedded Exploitation

📚 RAG Security, Retrieval Attacks, Poisoning Pipelines

My work typically involves jailbreak → code execution → exfiltration chains, agent/tool-call hijacks, RAG poisoning, secure-boot bypasses, baseband exploitation, and RF/PHY fuzzing.
I enjoy turning theoretical weaknesses into reproducible exploit chains and building security controls to prevent them.

🧨 What I Do
🔒 Offensive AI Security

Multi-turn jailbreak design

Safety-filter evasion research

RAG attack surface mapping

Prompt/embedding poisoning

Agent misuse, tool-hijacking, memory corruption

Model extraction, dataset poisoning, backdoor reconstruction

📶 Telecom + Wireless + Hardware Security

LTE/5G RAN & Core protocol fuzzing

GTP/NGAP/PFCP/O-RAN fuzz harness development

SDR-based signal manipulation (USRP, BladeRF)

Firmware extraction & secure-boot bypass

Black-box hardware analysis & reverse engineering

🧪 Featured Projects
🔥 Adversarial LLM Red Teaming Toolkit

Toolkit for multi-model jailbreak evaluation, refusal-delta testing, persona drift mapping, and automated exploit generation.

🧩 Damn Vulnerable LLM & Agent Framework

A purposely insecure LLM/agent environment for testing RAG poisoning, tool-call hijacking, memory/state leakage, and embedding corruption.

🛰️ 5G/RAN Fuzzing Harnesses

AFL++/LibAFL fuzz setups targeting GTP, NGAP, PFCP, O-RAN to identify RAN/Core misimplementations and memory-corruption vectors.

🛠️ Evil-Boot

Secure-boot bypass exploit enabling code execution on production IoT/embedded devices — used for vendor fixes and architecture hardening.

🐉 Fun Fact

I break AI systems for a living — but I also break actual physical devices.
Few people do both. I like being one of them. 😄
